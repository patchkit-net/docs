<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-it">How to get started with it?</h2>

<p>See <a href="getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

<p>For our current offer, please visit our <a href="https://patchkit.net/pricing.html">pricing</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-build-a-launcher-application">Do I need to build a launcher application?</h2>

<p><strong>Definitely not!</strong> PatchKit is a drop-in solution. If you have your game, just upload it, and you will be supplied with a <em>launcher</em> application. Download it and share it with anyone you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-upload-my-game">How can I upload my game?</h2>

<p>First, you have to create application entry using the <a href="https://panel.patchkit.net">Panel</a>. Once you’ve done it you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zip your game and drop it into Web UI upload form.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="tools.html">Console Tools</a> to upload it directly from your PC.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/patchkit-net/patchkit-integration-unity/tree/tools-integration">Unity integration</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>After being uploaded your file contents will be processed. You will see a progress bar of this operation. Just wait a moment to see if everything is all right.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-publish-my-game">How can I publish my game?</h2>

<p>After uploading and processing your version, you will see a red <em>Publish</em> button in your draft version view. Just click it and confirm your intent. You will be notified when your version is published and ready to be downloaded!</p>

<h2 id="where-can-my-players-download-my-game">Where can my players download my game?</h2>

<p>The only way your players can download your game is by sharing the <strong>launcher</strong> application with them. The <strong>launcher</strong> application can be downloaded by you on your application’s page, or you can share a publish download link with your players. This can be found on your application’s page as well.</p>

<h2 id="will-my-players-need-to-re-download-my-game-when-a-new-version-is-published">Will my players need to re-download my game when a new version is published?</h2>

<p><strong>Definitely not!</strong> PatchKit is heavily dependent on binary diffs. For every version, you’re publishing there’s a binary diff generated on our servers. It will be downloaded and applied by your players as soon as they launch your game. The procedure is really fast and in most cases, they don’t need to wait longer than several seconds based on network and PC performance.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-a-version-patch">How to prepare a version patch?</h2>

<p>You don’t have to do that at all. Just upload your new version’s ZIP file to the panel, and PatchKit will take care of the rest. Other ways of uploading your versions is by using our command-line tools or Unity extension.</p>

<h2 id="my-patch-size-is-quite-big-why">My patch size is quite big. Why?</h2>

<p>There may be several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ve made some significant changes, and there’s no way around it.</li>
  <li>You’ve uploaded a wrong game by mistake.</li>
  <li>You’ve renamed your files or directories. PatchKit currently does not support this kind of scenario very well.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="every-time-i-launch-my-application-it-re-downloads-some-of-the-files">Every time I launch my application, it re-downloads some of the files.</h2>

<p>That usually means that your build includes files that are being modified by your application. Log files maybe? Make sure to remove those before sending the build.</p>

<p>Launcher assumes that any installed file has changed its contents may be corrupted, and it’s safer to re-download it. It takes the same action if a file is missing, but ignores any files created after the installation procedure.</p>

<p>If your use case requires to modify files that are included in the build, try generating those on the first launch or install a template somewhere more buried in the directory tree to make a copy later.</p>

<h2 id="how-big-games-can-patchkit-handle">How big games can PatchKit handle?</h2>

<p>There’s no hard limit to that. PatchKit is designed to handle applications of any size. It has been tested with tiny few-megabytes games and with huge ones (100 gigabytes and more).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-runner-and-launcher">What is the difference between runner and launcher?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Runner</strong> - a small application used for downloading the newest version of the <strong>launcher</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Launcher</strong> - a bigger application used for downloading the newest version of target <strong>software</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-a-runner">Why do we need a runner?</h2>

<p><strong>Runner</strong> allows us to release any potential updates for the launcher. It doesn’t use any patching algorithms to update the launcher - it simply redownloads the whole launcher to <strong>keep it as simple as possible.</strong></p>

<h2 id="id-like-to-use-patchkit-behind-a-firewall-which-domain-names-and-ports-should-i-add-to-my-whitelist">I’d like to use PatchKit behind a firewall. Which domain names and ports should I add to my whitelist?</h2>

<p>You should whitelist all <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.patchkit.net</code> domains (using a wildcard). Make sure to open the following ports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Outgoing TCP 80</li>
  <li>Outgoing TCP 443</li>
</ul>

<p><em>It’s highly recommended</em> to open these ports as well for the best performance possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Outgoing TCP 9292 to any *.patchkit.net</li>
  <li>Outgoing UDP 443 to any IP</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-arguments-are-passed-by-runnerlauncher-to-my-application">What arguments are passed by runner/launcher to my application?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Built-in arguments pairs starting with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> character. It can look like <code class="highlighter-rouge">+key value</code>. If your application is relying on a passed argument list, make sure to ignore these pairs.</li>
  <li>Custom arguments provided by you. These are added right after the built-in argument list.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="when-i-try-to-run-the-launcher-i-see-windows-protected-your-pc-popup">When I try to run the launcher I see “Windows protected your PC” popup</h2>

<p>This popup is generated by Microsoft Windows SmartScreen to prevent unknown application from running. It can be easily omitted by clicking on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">More Info</code> link and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run anyway</code> button.</p>

<p>To prevent this message from displaying, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sign your code with a <a href="/launcher_certificate.html">code signing certificate</a></li>
  <li>Leave it be - after some time SmartScreen learns that this application is not harmful and it won’t be shown to the new users</li>
</ul>
