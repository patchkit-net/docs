<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-it">How to get started with it?</h2>

<p>See <a href="getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

<p>During the <em>Open Beta</em> it’s totally free! After the <em>Open Beta</em> we’d like to keep it free for small developers and introduce a reasonable pricing for more serious developers.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-build-a-patcher-application">Do I need to build a patcher application?</h2>

<p><strong>Definetely not!</strong> PatchKit is a drop-in solution. If you have your game, just upload it, and you will be supplied with a <em>launcher</em> application. Download it and share it with anyone you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-upload-my-game">How can I upload my game?</h2>

<p>First you have to create application entry using the <a href="https://panel.patchkit.net">Panel</a>. Once you’ve done it you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zip your game and drop it into Web UI upload form.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="tools.html">Console Tools</a> to upload it directly from your PC.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/patchkit-net/patchkit-integration-unity/tree/tools-integration">Unity integration</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>After being uploaded your file contents will be processed. You will see a progress bar of this operation. Just wait a moment to see if everything is alright.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-publish-my-game">How can I publish my game?</h2>

<p>After uploading and processing your version you will see a red <em>Publish</em> button in your draft version view. Just click it and confirm your intent. You will be notified when your version is published and ready to be downloaded!</p>

<h2 id="where-can-my-players-download-my-game">Where can my players download my game?</h2>

<p>The only way your players can download your game is by sharing the <strong>launcher</strong> application with them. The <strong>launcher</strong> application can be downloaded only by you on your game’s page, and your game’s page is visible only for you.</p>

<p>PatchKit is neither a store nor a marketplace. You can think of it as a mirror servers service with additional features. You’re uploading your game and then you’re sharing your game on your own web page, on your own store or with your friends.</p>

<h2 id="will-my-players-need-to-re-download-my-game-when-a-new-version-is-published">Will my players need to re-download my game when a new version is published?</h2>

<p><strong>Definitely not!</strong> PatchKit is heavily dependent on binary diffs. For every version you’re publishing there’s a binary diff generated on our servers. It will be downloaded and applied by your players as soon as they launch your game. The procedure is really fast and in most cases they don’t need to wait longer than several seconds based on network and PC performance.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-prepare-patches">Should I prepare patches?</h2>

<p>No, you shouldn’t. Patches are built by PatchKit servers. Everything is fully automated and you will be notified of the patch size we managed to achieve.</p>

<h2 id="my-patch-size-is-pretty-big-why">My patch size is pretty big. Why?</h2>

<p>There may be several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ve made some big changes and there’s no way around it.</li>
  <li>You’ve uploaded a wrong game by mistake.</li>
  <li>You’ve renamed your files or directories. PatchKit currently does not support this kind of scenario very well.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-big-games-can-patchkit-handle">How big games can PatchKit handle?</h2>

<p>There’s no limit. PatchKit is designed to handle games of any size. It has been tested with really small few-magabytes games and with really big ones (10 gigabytes and more).</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-common-use-cases">What are some common use cases?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pre-releases for testing purposes</li>
  <li>Games with subscription-based business model</li>
  <li>Games with free-to-play business model</li>
  <li>Games meant for limited audience (e.g. training, educational)</li>
  <li>Backend-side for game marketplaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-launcher-and-patcher">What is the difference between launcher and patcher?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Launcher</strong> - a small application used for downloading the newest version of <strong>patcher</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Patcher</strong> - a complex application used for downloading the newest version of <strong>application</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-a-launcher">Why do we need a launcher?</h2>

<p><strong>Launcher</strong> Launcher allows us to release any potential updates for the patcher. It doesn’t use any patching algorithms to update the patcher - it simply redownloads the whole patcher to <strong>keep it as simple as possible.</strong></p>
